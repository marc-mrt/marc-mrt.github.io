# Experience.

## Staff engineer, Passbase

_Aug '19 - Current_

`go` `sql` `typescript` `nextjs` `react` `webpack` `styled-components` `aws` `terraform` `ddd` `architecture` `leadership` `management` `hiring` `security`

A VC-backed start-up providing identity verification services.

Having joined in the early stages, I was tasked to build the first verions of 3 core apps' frontends.
Moved on to take part of the hiring process of the next members of the frontend team & lead them to maintain, and extend the apps.

After some time, products being bound to evolve, the team proceeded to architecture a new version of the product using new technologies, following a domain-driven design approach.
I took part of the entire process, end to end, where I had the opportunity to jump on the other side of the fence, learning new technologies as well.

We are right now bringing that new product to life in an iterative fashion, improving our technological security posture and migrating our customer base to it.

## Software engineer, Recare

_Jun. '18 - Mar. '20_

`typescript` `javascript` `flow` `react` `redux` `graphql` `rest` `webpack` `babel` `e2e encryption` `cryptography`

An automated patient transfer utility product servicing Germany's clinics.

In this role, I've maintained and extended an existing product suite of 3 apps.
Dealing with patient data, it was of upmost importance to ensure the company had no view into it, for which we used and maintain our own e2e encryption solution.

After joining, it became obvious that the codebase became hard to maintain, which triggered migrating an entire codebase from the Flow type system to TypeScript, a procedure that we could only conduct at once given their incompatibility.
At the time of shipping, we relied on our e2e integration test to validate the transition.

While extending its market ambition towards France, the products required to be translated, a challenge we decided to tackle in-house, thus building a new app from scratch to easily extend, update, and synchronize terms with all our apps & codebases.

## Frontend developer, Intern, Mhirba

_Apr. '17 - Aug. '17_

`javascript` `flow` `react` `angular` `vue` `electron` `iot` `prototyping`

This craft studio for hire was managed by its only founder, working with big companies to prototype IoT products.

I developed a frontend for a cross-platform app and assess what best tools to use for the task.
Fast-paced iteration was key to ensure the prototype fits the needs of the customer with quick feedback loops.

## Game developer, Intern, Wolcen

_Sep. '15 - Dec. '15_

`cpp` `actionscript 2.0` `cry engine 3` `entity-component-system` `documentation`

This indie game studio was working on its first early-access game.

I helped the team build the game menus, its dependency management and shader compilation.
The team was short-handed at the time and looking to expend, which required thorough documentation for all steps taken during development.

# Education.

## Epitech

_Sep. '14 - Aug. '19_

`c` `cpp` `java` `sql` `tdd` `architecture` `management`

During this 5-year long program, I've learned to love programming, embrace new technologies and navigate a lot of different angles to software engineering.

In the final years, most of the program was aimed at entrepreneurship and innovation within the sector, learnings I carry with me to this day when working on tech products.
