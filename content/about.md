# Experience

## Staff engineer, Passbase

_Aug '19 - Current_

`go` `ruby` `rails` `sql` `typescript` `react` `nextjs` `react` `webpack` `styled-components` `aws` `terraform` `ddd` `architecture` `leadership` `management` `hiring` `security`

A VC-backed startup providing identity verification services worldwide.

I joined in the early stages, building the first versions of 3 core apps' frontends, and moved on to take part in the hiring process of the frontend team, leading them to maintain and extend the apps.

After achieving product-market fit, the engineering team architectured a new product using new technologies, following a domain-driven design.
I took part in the entire process where I had the opportunity to actively contribute on all sides: frontend, backend, and platform.

Currently iterating on our product suite, delivering bit-sized quality features to better suit the needs of a growing customer base.

## Software engineer, Recare

_Jun. '18 - Mar. '20_

`typescript` `javascript` `flow` `react` `redux` `graphql` `rest` `webpack` `babel` `e2e encryption` `cryptography`

A patient-transfer service for clinics in Germany.

In this role, I was part of the team that maintained and extended an existing product suite of 3 apps.
Dealing with patient data, it was of utmost importance to ensure the company had no view into it, for which we used and maintained our e2e encryption solution.

After joining, it became evident that the codebase was hard to maintain. We migrated the entire codebase from the Flow type system to TypeScript, a procedure we could only conduct in full at once.
We relied on our e2e integration test to validate that transition.

While extending its market ambition towards France, the products required internationalization, a challenge we decided to tackle by building a new app from scratch to update and synchronize terms within all our apps & codebases.

## Frontend developer, Intern, Mhirba

_Apr. '17 - Aug. '17_

`javascript` `flow` `react` `angular` `vue` `electron` `iot` `prototyping`

A craft studio for hire, managed by its only founder, working with big companies to prototype IoT products.

I developed a frontend for a cross-platform app, assessing various technologies for the job.
Fast-paced iteration was essential to ensure the prototype fits the customer's needs with quick feedback loops.

## Game developer, Intern, Wolcen

_Sep. '15 - Dec. '15_

`cpp` `actionscript 2.0` `cry engine 3` `entity-component-system` `documentation`

An indie game studio that was working on its first game's release.

I helped the team build the game menus, dependency management, and shader compilation.
The team was short-handed at the time and looking to expand, which required thorough documentation for all steps taken during development.

# Education

## Epitech

_Sep. '14 - Aug. '19_

`c` `cpp` `java` `sql` `tdd` `architecture` `management`

During this 5-year program, I've learned to love programming, embrace new technologies and navigate a lot of different angles to software engineering.

In the final years, most of the program focused on entrepreneurship and innovation within the sector, learnings I carry with me to this day when working on tech products.
