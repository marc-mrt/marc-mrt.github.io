I’m Marc Morant, a product engineer dedicated to crafting impactful, user-driven solutions. Over the past 7+ years, I’ve collaborated with startups and scale-ups to deliver high-quality, scalable systems that empower businesses and users alike.

My passion lies at the intersection of technology and meaningful user experiences. Whether driving product innovation, architecting fault-tolerant systems, or leading cross-functional teams, I thrive in dynamic environments that demand creativity, precision, and adaptability.
I’m eager to continue solving complex challenges with practical, lasting solutions.

{{< about-sub-section-title title="Product engineer" location="Midlane" timeframe="Nov '23 - Jun '25" skills="TypeScript, Next.js, React, SQL, AWS, Lambda, Queue, Events, DDD, Architecture, Security, Leadership, Product" >}}

Built HR technology for the underserved blue-collar market at this early-stage startup.

Working closely with our small team, I contributed to foundational product decisions and technical architecture. We delivered focused features rapidly while maintaining quality standards, helping the company iterate toward product-market fit in a demanding, fast-changing environment.
The primary problematics were datapoint collection, document generation, and employee onboarding funnels.

{{< about-sub-section-title title="Lead engineer" location="Klarna" timeframe="Jul '23 - Oct '23" skills="TypeScript, NestJS, React, SQL, React Native, Lambda, SQS, IaC, Events, Architecture, Leadership, Product" >}}

Led engineering efforts in the Card & Banking domain, focusing on improving user experience across mobile and web platforms of the Klarna app. I focused on shipping a new documents delivery mechanism for bank users.

Though my time was brief, I made the difficult decision to leave for an exceptional opportunity that better aligned with my goals.

{{< about-sub-section-title title="Staff engineer" location="Passbase" timeframe="Aug '19 - Jun '23" skills="Go, Ruby, Rails, SQL, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Webpack, Styled-Components, AWS, Terraform, DDD, Architecture, Leadership, Management, Hiring, Security" >}}

Grew with this VC-backed identity verification startup from early-stage through successful acquisition.

Initially built frontend foundations for 3 core applications, then evolved into hiring and leading our growing frontend team. When we achieved product-market fit, I contributed to architecting our next-generation platform using domain-driven design principles—working across frontend, backend, and infrastructure.

{{< about-sub-section-title title="Software engineer" location="Recare" timeframe="Jun. '18 - Mar. '20" skills="TypeScript, JavaScript, Flow, React, Redux, GraphQL, REST, Webpack, Babel, E2E Encryption" >}}

Developed secure healthcare software for patient transfer services across German clinics.

Working with sensitive patient data required zero-trust architecture—I maintained and improved our end-to-end encryption system ensuring complete data privacy. When I identified maintainability issues in our legacy codebase, our team executed a complete Flow-to-TypeScript migration, using comprehensive end-to-end tests to ensure reliability throughout the transition.

For international expansion into France, I built a dedicated internationalization management app from scratch, enabling synchronized translations across our entire product suite and streamlining our localization workflow.

{{< about-sub-section-title title="Frontend developer (intern)" location="Mhirba" timeframe="Apr. '17 - Aug. '17" skills="JavaScript, Flow, React, Angular, Vue, Electron, IoT, Prototyping" >}}

Prototyped IoT interfaces for enterprise clients at this specialized craft studio.

I evaluated and implemented frontend solutions across multiple frameworks (React, Angular, Vue) for cross-platform applications. The rapid prototyping environment taught me to balance technical exploration with practical client feedback loops—skills.

{{< about-sub-section-title title="Game developer (intern)" location="Wolcen" timeframe="Sep. '15 - Dec. '15" skills="C++, ActionScript 2.0, CryEngine 3, Entity-Component-System, Documentation" >}}

Contributed to game development at this indie studio during their first major release cycle.

I implemented game menus, improved dependency management, and worked on shader compilation systems. With the team preparing to scale, I created detailed technical documentation.

{{< about-sub-section-title title="Master's Degree" location="Epitech" timeframe="Sep. '14 - Aug. '19" skills="C, C++, Java, SQL, TDD, Architecture, Management" >}}

Epitech’s hands-on curriculum empowered me to develop practical skills from the start, fostering independence through its self-learning approach. I honed my ability to write clean, maintainable code and thrive under tight deadlines, both individually and within teams. My coursework explored fundamental and advanced topics in software engineering, including low-level programming (C and C++) and software architecture.

{{< about-sub-section-title title="Molecule" timeframe="'18 - '19" skills="JavaScript, Flow, React, Redux, CSS, Styled-Components, Babel, RxJS, LSP" url="https://github.com/marc-mrt/atom-molecule-dev-environment" >}}

While the project was eventually discontinued, it offered valuable insight into managing cross-border collaboration and working in an open-source community.

{{< about-sub-section-title title="Eniverse" timeframe="'18" skills="JavaScript, Flow, React, CSS, Styled-Components, Webpack, Babel" url="https://github.com/marc-mrt/Eniverse-Showcase" >}}

Solely designed and implemented a robust and refined web platform for an e-sports agency. This project illustrated the importance of aligning technical solutions with business goals, as close collaboration with non-technical stakeholders was integral to its success. Aside from the technical perspective, it offered me end-to-end exposure to delivering and hosting polished software in real-world conditions.
