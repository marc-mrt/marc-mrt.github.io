I'm Marc Morant, a product-focused software engineer who thrives at the intersection of technology and user impact.
Over 7+ years, I've worked with companies ranging from early-stage startups to scale-ups.
I'm looking to continue my journey building products that impact people's lives positively.

{{< about-sub-section-title title="Product engineer" location="Midlane" timeframe="Nov '23 - Jun '25" skills="typescript, next, react, sql, aws, lambda, queue, events, ddd, architecture, security, leadership, product" >}}

Built HR technology for the underserved blue-collar market at this early-stage startup.

Working closely with our small team, I contributed to foundational product decisions and technical architecture. We delivered focused features rapidly while maintaining quality standards, helping the company iterate toward product-market fit in a demanding, fast-changing environment.

{{< about-sub-section-title title="Lead engineer" location="Klarna" timeframe="Jul '23 - Oct '23" skills="typescript, nest, react, sql, react-native, lambda, sqs, iac, events, architecture, leadership, product" >}}

Led engineering efforts in the Card & Banking domain, focusing on improving user experience across mobile and web platforms of the Klarna app.

Though my time was brief, I made the difficult decision to leave for an exceptional opportunity that better aligned with my goals.

Grew with this VC-backed identity verification startup from early-stage through successful acquisition.

Initially built frontend foundations for 3 core applications, then evolved into hiring and leading our growing frontend team. When we achieved product-market fit, I contributed to architecting our next-generation platform using domain-driven design principles—working across frontend, backend, and infrastructure.

{{< about-sub-section-title title="Software engineer" location="Recare" timeframe="Jun. '18 - Mar. '20" skills="typescript, javascript, flow, react, redux, graphql, rest, webpack, babel, e2e encryption" >}}

Developed secure healthcare software for patient transfer services across German clinics.

Working with sensitive patient data required zero-trust architecture—I maintained and improved our end-to-end encryption system ensuring complete data privacy. When I identified maintainability issues in our legacy codebase, our team executed a complete Flow-to-TypeScript migration, using comprehensive end-to-end tests to ensure reliability throughout the transition.

For international expansion into France, I built a dedicated internationalization management app from scratch, enabling synchronized translations across our entire product suite and streamlining our localization workflow.

{{< about-sub-section-title title="Frontend developer (intern)" location="Mhirba" timeframe="Apr. '17 - Aug. '17" skills="javascript, flow, react, angular, vue, electron, iot, prototyping" >}}

Prototyped IoT interfaces for enterprise clients at this specialized craft studio.

I evaluated and implemented frontend solutions across multiple frameworks (React, Angular, Vue) for cross-platform applications. The rapid prototyping environment taught me to balance technical exploration with practical client feedback loops—skills.

{{< about-sub-section-title title="Game developer (intern)" location="Wolcen" timeframe="Sep. '15 - Dec. '15" skills="cpp, actionscript 2.0, cry engine 3, entity-component-system, documentation" >}}

Contributed to game development at this indie studio during their first major release cycle.

I implemented game menus, improved dependency management, and worked on shader compilation systems. With the team preparing to scale, I created detailed technical documentation.
