ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€˜m Marc Morant, software engineer. I currently work for [Passbase](https://passbase.com) in Berlin where I've helped architect & build their product lines as well as hire part of the team. Previously at [Recare](https://recaresolutions.com/) a health startup to ease patient transfer, [Mhirba](https://www.mhirba.com/) a craft studio for hire, [Wolcen](https://wolcengame.com/) an indie game studio.

I've created applications from scratch in the context of early-stage start-ups, sustained forever-changing requirements by iterating on existing systems, and managed small teams.
Along this journey, Iâ€˜ve specialized in web technologies, building data-driven interactive apps with tools such as:
[`TypeScript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [`Go`](https://go.dev/), [`Terraform`](https://www.terraform.io/), [`NestJS`](https://nestjs.com/), [`ReactJS`](https://reactjs.org/), [`NextJS`](https://nextjs.org/).

Though, my passion is developer experience, and alleviating grunt-work from developers' lifes. I believe the overall effectiveness of a team to be best by allowing developers to focus on creative thinking and pure execution.

Happy to talk, feel free to reach out via the links at the bottom of the page or by email (hello _at_ morant _dot_ me).
