Hi, I‘m Marc Morant, software engineer. Currently working at [Passbase](https://passbase.com) as a staff engineer.

I‘ve specialized in web app development over the years with an emphasis on frontend and tools such as [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/). Nowadays, I‘m tackling new challenges by diving into backend learning [Go](https://go.dev/).
