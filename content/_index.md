Hi, I‘m Marc Morant, software engineer.

I am currently stationned in Berlin, where I work for [Passbase](https://passbase.com), hepling architect & building their product lines and teams.

I've created applications from scratch in the context of early-stage start-ups, sustained forever-changing requirements by iterating on existing systems, and managed small teams.
Along this journey, I‘ve specialized in web technologies by building data-driven, interactive apps with various technologies.

Though, my passion is developer experience, and alleviating grunt-work from developers' lifes. I believe the overall effectiveness of a team to be best by allowing developers to focus on creative thinking and pure execution.

Feel free to reach out to me by email (hello _at_ morant _dot_ me), happy to chat.
