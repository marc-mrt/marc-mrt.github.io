title: Hi, I'm Marc 👋

Sometimes, I use this space to share some [thoughts]({{< ref "/blog" >}} "click here to go to my blog posts"), and keep an updated [CV]({{< ref "/about" >}} "click here to go to my cv"). Feel free to check those out, whatever speaks to you.

If you want to chat, you can write me at marc _at_ mrnt _dot_ fr, or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marc-mrt/) and find me [GitHub](https://github.com/marc-mrt/).

That's it, be well and thanks for swinging by!
