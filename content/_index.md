Hi, my name is Marc Morant, software engineer.

I live in Berlin, where I help architect & build [Passbase](https://passbase.com).

I created applications from scratch in the context of early-stage start-ups, sustained forever-changing requirements by iterating on existing systems, and managed small teams.
Along this journey, I specialized in web technologies by building data-driven, interactive apps with various technologies.

Though, my passion is developer experience and alleviating grunt-work from developers' lives. I believe the overall effectiveness of a team is best when developers can focus on creative thinking and pure execution.

Feel free to reach out to me by email at hello _at_ morant _dot_ me.
