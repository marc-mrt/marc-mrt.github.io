Welcome to my internet thing, I'm glad you're here!

I'm a software engineer based in Berlin, and here is the place I share content online. In that spirit, do check out my [blog]({{< ref "/blog" >}} "click here to go to my blog") where I talk about engineering software for the web or my [CV]({{< ref "/about" >}} "click here to go to my cv") if that speaks to you.

I'm always happy to talk, feel to reach out to me via [email](mailto:hello@morant.me), [GitHub](https://github.com/marc-mrt/) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marc-mrt/).
